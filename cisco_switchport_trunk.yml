### playbook goal:  get buy-off from your organization that network engineers should be trusted to make minor changes during the day.
### mistake proof the process and take human error out of the process by using ansible to automate the task.
### outcome: "switchport trunk allowed" playbook can be run by anyone 
### (give this junior level task to someone else - or even let the server team own it)

### use ansible to add new vlans to an existing trunk interfaces to an esx cluster
### benefit of this playbook is that the code itself doenst need to change - only the seed file gets touched.

### To run the playbook with a specific seed file:
### ansible-playbook cisco_switchport_trunk.yml -i inventory/Cisco/blah/blah -e "include_vars=torx-y.yml"
